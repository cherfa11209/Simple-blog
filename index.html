    <h3>A christmas in the life of an aspiring Web Developer</h3>
    <div>
        <p> Hello everyone, and happy holidays! 
            It's been a very eventful years and a lot of us can say it's even been a horrible year.
            The <a href ="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">Covid-19 Virus</a> 
            has changed our very way of being, most of us have decided to change the direction of our lives since then.
            I'm very grateful that I decided to learn to code this year, it's made me into a better person, I have really learned to love
            everything to do with computers.

            3 practices that I have found to be very benefical are:
            <ul>
                <li>Daily practice</li>
                <li>Keeping checklists</li>
                <li>Setting small goals</li>
                <li>Chatting with my peers on discord</li>
                <li>Watching educational youtube videos</li>
            </ul> 
            
            It's  been such a pleasure that even on Christmas day all I've wanted to do is study and build my own websites. 
            I would really like to thank <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, <em>
                Andrei Neagoie </em> and <a target = "_blank" href = "https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/">Harvard's CS50</a>
                for helping me through this journey, they have been wonderful resources, I would also like to give a special thanks to <strong>Stack Overflow</strong>
                for having all the answers to problems I couldn't have solved my self.
